            <p class= "p_modal">I love this book. I think roald dahl is just inspirational with his words and uses them very wisely in the book under the name of matilda. It is very creative how Matilda has special powers in her eyes and can, with some practice, make a peice of chalk at her school called Crunchem Hall move around and write a message on the board to her spiteful headmaster to persaude her into giving Matilda's teacher's mansion back.  I like Ms.Honey because she is wise and helpful like Matilda. nevertheless of Matilda's extraordianary powers her parents are spiteful and stupid and care about nothing else other than their 12 inch televison screen which keeps on flickering on about soap operas. At the end of the book it is a happy ending where Matilda gets to live with Ms.Honey in her mansion and not run off to Spain with her dad and mum and brother. Matilda started school late but was still learning early by the age of 3 she could read all the newspapers in the house and by the age 4, was wandering off to the library on her own and burying her nose deep into the books of Charles Dickens. I recommend this book for everyone in hope that they will like it as much as I do.
